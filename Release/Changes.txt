----------------------------------------------------------

###

 - Changed: program now saves its settings to LBAPackEd.ini file insted of config.ini file. Please change the name of your config.ini file to "LBAPackEd.ini" to prevent loss of your custom settings.
 - Fixed: entries of *.obl files now have correct *.lm2 extensions instead on *.lfn.
 - New extension: *.grf (Grid Fragment) - for the files between grids and libraries in lba_bkg.hqr (LBA 2).
 - Fixed: program now recognizes souscelb.ile and souscelb.obj files.
 - Changed: file information files now have .hqd (HQR Description) extension instead of .dat
 - Changed: when opening a package file the program now will look for a .hqd file with the same name as the package file in the directory where the package file is. If the .hqd file is found, the program will load information for the package file from that file, otherwise the program will look for appropriate .hqd file in the program directory (\fileinfo). This way you can make your own description files for your own modified package files and make them to be loaded with them only.
 - Improved: path and info hint popups now cover the path/info texts, so that they are easier to read
 - New: Info and Replace columns now have popup hints (appearing if text is longer than column width, or for paths - if full path is longer than column width). Path column hint displays full path instead of minimized path.
 
### Changes in version 0.11+:

 - Added support for High Quality Scenarios (*.hqs). Not complete though, but you can at least extract and replace entries.  

### Changes in version 0.11:
 
 - Changed: Extension *.lsc is now split into *.ls1 and *.ls2
 - Changed: Extension *.bll is now split into *.bl1 and *.bl2
 - Changed: Extension *.l3d is now split into *.lm1 and *.lm2
 - Fixed: Error during extracting including info text in the file name, when info text contained illegal characters. Now all illegal characters will be replaced with "_".
 - Fixed: When you opened one entry with a tool, all the other entries were seen as "opened" also.
 - Changed: Extension *.pal is now universal extension. It means that you can open it together with any other file type, not only the one that is associated with the same tool. For example, if you have *.pal and *.lim associated with ImageViewer, and *.lm1 associated with 3DViewer, you can select a pal file together with a lm1 file, and open them with 3DViewer, as well as select pal+lim and open them with ImageViewer.

### Changes in version 0.10+:

 - Fixed: Menus are now working properly under Win98 (thanks OBrasilo)

### Changes in version 0.10:
 - Fixed: Removed file name length limit in partial extract dialog.
 - Fixed: bug that caused "Specify output file" small button not to go enabled.
 - Fixed: bug that caused internal replacements index to decrease on its own in some cases
  - Improved: Program now uses my unit that gives XP-style to menus and toolbars instead of Delphi's ActionToolbar, thus you will be able to open source code in Delphi 7 Personal, and the program looks overally nicer.
 - Improved: Shaded progress bar like in LBArchitect
 - Improved: Column widths will be saved (if you enabled "Remember these settings" in "Columns" menu).


### Changes in version 0.09:
 - You can now open two or more entries with one tool at the same time (if the same tool is assigned to all of them), for example lim and pal.
 - Fixed hints for "Display blank entries" and "Compact blank entries" menu items.
 - New extension: pcx - contained by fla_pcx.hqr file in some diskette versions of LBA 1
 - Fixed tool execution procedures for some extensions (they were badly linked)

### Changes in version 0.08b:
 - Extension "gri" changed to "gr1" and added extension "gr2".

 - You can now include entry info texts in the extracted files names (idea by AlexFont), you can turn it on in settings
 - Added option to skip repeated entries during partial extracting

 - New options: "extract to temp" and "replace from temp" added in order to make opening related files (e.g. *.lim and *.pal) easier

 - Due to these reasons the program doesn't asks for display mode any more
 - Display options are now reduced to blank entry displaying option
 - New feature: "Compact blank entries" - displays each block of blank entries in only one row

### Changes in version 0.06:
